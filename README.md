# yaNOVA
This is the beginnings of a DG NOVA simulator.
The project goal is to run Mapped RDOS.

Changes:
  * DSK simulation (not debugged), cached in memory, write protection
  * LPT simulation (not debugged), file I/O, accepts parameters
      -DEVproperty=value
  * inital revision, somewhat working virtual console, not debugged.

**NOTE**: Good luck!
